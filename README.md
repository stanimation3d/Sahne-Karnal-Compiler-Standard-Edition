# Sahne Karnal Compiler
Sahne Karnal Compiler is a special compiler developed by Sahne Dünya for its own independent operating system project Sahne Karnal. Sahne Karnal project is the largest operating system project developed by Sahne Dünya. However, when creating an operating system from scratch, it usually does not require a special compiler, although they offer operating system options, it is not required! We can configure the existing compiler according to the operating system we have created! But why Sahne Dünya developed a special compiler, of course the answer is to provide full control, full stability, full consistency, full performance. Sahne Karnal Compiler does not use LLVM infrastructure, instead it uses its own infrastructure. This compiler first supports Rust language because Sahne Karnal architecture is mostly written in Rust language, However, it is planned to support multiple programming languages ​​in the future, At the same time, Multi-CPU architecture support is planned, this is because Sahne Karnal already supports multiple architectures. Supported system calls are Karnal64 and its infrastructure, the most popular example of the user-kernel communication API is Sahne64 etc. The most ideal Linker supported by this compiler is GAXE Linker, see the other project for more information about this tool!
